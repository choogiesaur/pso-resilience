1. Load and save everything as Server Quest GC
	- for raw quests that can be inserted into an .iso, use Quest Files manager and export both
	- take note if the .dat is empty or not (if it is the quest wont have npcs/warps)

2. If testing with fuzziqer server, export as Kohle GC

3. Filenames should be pretty short and boring in config.ini or it barfs

4. Keep trying if fuzzi download doesn't work and pay attention to the 
   generated files (if the names look messed up there's a problem)
