- use adxenc.exe with adx frontend guid
- use audacity to find loop points in samples, not seconds
- encode, then replace in iso HOWEVER
level bgm seems to be in small files of 4,8,etc. measures each - different ones are played
depending on the context like enemies approaching, etc. (forest music vs forest battle music)

sooooo....it'll be pretty hard to mod the music for levels :) but POSSIBLE with a lot of work

you can however swap the adx files in the root and have them trigger with qedit opcodes (bgm, etc.)
tested with Fall Out Boy christmas song and it loops perfectly 8)
