Instructions for making custom music:
- use adxenc.exe with adx frontend gui
- use audacity to find desired loop points in SAMPLES, not seconds
- encode (wav -> adx), then replace original file in iso

HOWEVER:
level bgm seems to be in small files of 4,8, etc. measures each - different ones are played
depending on the context like enemies approaching, etc. (forest music vs forest battle music)

so you'd have to make a composition that fits those 4/8 measure structures and sounds good when transitioning.
all in all, a bit difficult to mod the music for levels :) but POSSIBLE with a lot of work

you can however swap the adx files in the root and have them trigger with qedit opcodes 
(these are static, long background music files such as Lobby music, etc.)
tested with Fall Out Boy christmas song and it loops perfectly 8)
