Testing out a custom snowy-themed forest retexture and music swap on PSOGC. 

It worked pretty smoothly!

Stage Texture Notes:
- This is about half my own custom textures and half from an old Blue Burst texture pack I found by ShinAsura, google his Forest Winter Mod
- Porting BB stage textures to GC is fairly straightforward with a few caveats:
	- For textures within a stage's .xvm/.gvm that correspond to the same object, the Blue Burst version might be a higher resolution than the Gamecube version
	- I first tried a straight 1:1 swap of everything from .xvm -> .gvm, vmt will gladly accept higher-res textures in place of low-res ones
	- This resulted in numerous crashes/read errors in Dolphin. Oddly enough, no crashes on gamecube hardware.
	- To be safe I went back and re-did some of the mismatched textures:
	- Resized the large ones to the correct smaller size for GC then reinserted, and created new ones from scratch where the quality was iffy
	- Put back into the game which now seems to have no crashes on Dolphin or actual gamecube!

Music Notes:
- Music swapping may be pretty limited at the moment
- .adx files:
	- adxencd + frontend gui works nicely, loops function properly
	- use audacity to find loop points in # of samples
- Stage music:
	- The regular stage soundtracks are variable in nature; there's a basic loop which transitions to different loops when fighting enemies, etc.
	- These are hard to edit. They are stored in an archive, in bite-sized segments of a few measures each, and are repeatedly cued up depending on what's happening in-game
	- Arguably you could write a soundtrack in the same tempo (or a multiple of it) and chop it down into the same bite size pieces and replace them.
	- Bottom line the musical segments would have to be the same length as the original files and you could make it work.
	- It's a lot of work.
	- Fuck it I'm gonna try this at some point. Hahaha
- Special music:
	- There are 18 or so flat, looping .adx files on the root directory that CAN be swapped out painlessly.
	- A bunch of them correspond to in-game music discs
	- you can program a custom quest to play one of these in the background as soon as quest starts. create_bgmctrl and enable_bgmctrl
	- you still have to overwrite the music files, it'll be harder to add new ones as it seems there's a pointer table to usable music
