There are a number of .dds format photoshop plugins for windows and the ONLY one that has worked for me is the old NVIDIA plugin:

Get the legacy NVIDIA .dds plugin for photoshop:
	- https://developer.nvidia.com/legacy-texture-tools
	- click the Download button under dds utilities and it takes you to a page
	- Scroll down to "Texture Tools for Adobe Photoshop" and download that

Preserving Transparency in Modified Textures:
	When you export texture in VMT as .dds, it DOES keep transparency. To view it in photoshop, ctrl+click the alpha channel to select the transparent areas. Then under Layers click Add Mask.

Steps to edit textures:
1. Open PSO iso with GCR and extract the whole root folder
2. Open the texture archive you want to modify with VMT.exe
3. Click export all, select .dds, you'll get a folder full of the .dds textures
4. Modify the ones you want with Photoshop:
	- When you load it up, default sizes worked for me, maybe it should be 8 bit
	- Might need to load mip maps, but most of the textures I've seen in VMT dont have them
	- When you save it select DXT3 ARGB 8bpp | explicit alpha without mip maps
		(if you can find a plugin that actually has these settings it may work)
5. Import the texture in VMT choosing the gamecube format option. I chose "no transparency" but transparency still worked. Experiment with the options if it's not working.
6. Save the texture pack as gamecube .gvm
	- for .prs compressed texture archives: VMT seems to know how to decompress and open them;
	- you will have to recompress with prsutil.exe afterwards then reinsert into the game
	- f256_hyouji.prs in particular (HUD textures) seems to be a prs compressed .gvm
	- others may or may not be prs compressed.
7. Compress with prsutil (if applicable) and reinsert into the game.

"IMPORTING PRE MADE SKINS.

PSOBB has had skin mods for a very long time so if you just want a skin that already has been made then it is very possible to add them in to PSOGC too, while it is a itle bit more complicated.

What you have to do is download the skin you desire and open it in VMT now this is where we do something totally different, for some reason my VMT can not export the images from the PSOBB AFS on their own as GVR so we have to click "Image" and then "Export All" NOW AKE SURE THAT YOU EXPORT THE IMAGES AS "GC GVR format" now that the files are all extracted find where the modded skin is, for example is image 5 to 9 contained the modded skins import them to the GameCubes AFS."

Map textures:
'a' preceding filename seems to mean Ultimate. e.g:
map_aancient01.GVM - Ultimate mode textures for Ruins 1
map_ancient01.GVM  - Normal mode textures for Ruins 1
