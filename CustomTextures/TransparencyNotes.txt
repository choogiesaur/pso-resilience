Preserving Transparency in Modified Textures

When you export texture in VMT as .dds, it DOES keep transparency. To view it in photoshop, ctrl+click the alpha channel to select the transparent areas. Then under Layers click Add Mask.

Steps:
1. Export .dds
2. In the case of the HUD I tried shifting the hue/saturation. Saved it as DXT3 without mip maps.
3. f256_hyouji.prs in particular, seems to be a PRS compressed .gvm. Decompressing it with prsutil, then changing the extension to .gcm allows it to be read as such.
	3.a. Other textures may or may not be PRS compressed.
4. Import the texture. Experiment with the options, I chose GC to be safe and "No transparency", but transparency still worked. Some other settings seem to work too.
5. Save the texture pack as gamecube .gvm.
6. Compress with prsutil, and re insert into game. (If applicable)
