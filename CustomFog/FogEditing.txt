fogentry.dat can be edited! somewhat!
BB vs GC: bb is 16kb as opposed to 8kb owing to the additional areas

loading gc fogentry.dat in BB Fog Editor 003 works though most values are interpreted incorrectly
the color and alpha values at least are editable, and are in REVERSE BYTE ORDER from bb

e.g., the ARGB field in the base snowy forest mod for bb had a value of
00F0F0F0

which I flipped to->
F0F0F000

typed in that value, saved fogentry.dat, it loaded a nice white fog when I ran the iso.
F000F000 was a bright magenta (looks really cool over white forest)

so what you can do is play with the sliders to get the color you want, reverse the byte order, then save it.
ultimately: should make a fog editor that properly reads the gc file so we can modify the other values

gamecube:
[F0F0F0][00]
^color  ^alpha

FF for alpha may be more opaque than 00 or vice versa, couldn't really see a difference
